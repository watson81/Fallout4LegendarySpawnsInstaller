# Fallout4LegendarySpawnsInstaller
## Description
The [Customize Legendary Enemy Spawning](http://www.nexusmods.com/fallout4/mods/218) mod for Fallout 4 is great, but it doesn't include installation scripting. That means that users must either install it manually or they must alter the install manually when using a mod manager. In order to make things easier for users, I'm creating an installation system that will take care of this automatically.
